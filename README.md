# VizBox
Hi.
This is a constantly-updated project organized by Zpy.

The project is about an accessible toolkit for data scientists to explore VR data visualizations, which is supported by Unity 

The simple aim is that, with the simplest VR device(Google Cardboard) and this VizBox, the newbie of VR can also dive into the world of VR data visualization.
