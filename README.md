# VizBox
Hi,
This is the final project of COMP7704 organized by Peiyao.

The project is about an accessible toolkit for data scientists to explore VR data visualizations, which is supported by Unity 

One goal of this research is to explore the advantages of combining VR with data visualization. To achieve this goal, we must truly realize data visualization with VR devices. Considering many thresholds that ordinary users may encounter when approaching this field, including those equipment and knowledge difficulties, we need a tool that is universal and convenient for users from any background. In this research, I call this tool VizBox. As the name suggests, VizBox is like a magical box that can help users implement many data visualization, especially immersive visualizations. The original design aim of VizBox is to assist users with data visualization using the simplest VR device. The basic design refers to many immersive analysis literatures, such as IATK. The most intuitive feature of VizBox is to enable users to observe the visualization results from any perspective of vision in Unity, which means users can be able to adjust the data as they like in a 3D virtual environment. At the same time, VizBox also provides users with a platform to display visualization results. The virtual scene of VizBox is designed as an exhibition hall. Users can pack the project into an android application, so as to observe the visualization on their mobile devices. 

So I highly recommend potential users to get one Google Cardboard and download this Unity Package to create some 3D data models with their own datasets.
